# Babel Legacy Decorator plugin

This is a plugin for Babel 6 that is meant to replicate the old decorator behavior from
Babel 5 in order to allow people to more easily transition to Babel 6 without needing to
be blocked on updates to the decorator proposal or for Babel to re-implement it.


## Best Effort

Beware, this plugin is a best effort to maintain feature parity with Babel 5, but there
are slight differences if you were relied on side-effects between decorators in some
cases.
